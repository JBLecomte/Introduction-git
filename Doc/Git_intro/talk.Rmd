## What is version control

## What is version control

- If you are making copies of projects and renaming them so that you can make some modifications, you should be using version control.

- If you are taking somebody’s changes to their project and manually changing your slightly-different project to include the newest changes, you should be using version control.

- If you want to try something new (no matter how silly) with your code but don’t want to risk breaking your project, you should be using version control.


## Git

- Git is a distributed version control system. It was originally designed for Linux kernel developers in 2005.
- No server required, but in team projects a master repository is used on a server, we will be using GitHub.com, but there are others.
- If you want information about changes to the repository, or commit logs, it is all stored locally and no internet connection is required.

## GitHub

- This is where hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab come in.
- They provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as DropBox but much, much better.
- It allows other people to see your stuff, sync up with you, and perhaps even make changes. These hosting providers improve upon traditional Unix Git servers with well-designed web-based interfaces.



## Setup git
- Get a github account.
- Download and install git.

- Set up git with your user name and email. Open a terminal/shell and type:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
    git config --global user.name "Your name here"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

## Clone git project
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```


## Create a local Git repository
Go to your directory and open a shell
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:JBLecomte/Introduction-git.git
git push -u origin master
```
